# Defi_codes
Hello, Im Chenxi new guy in Ethereum, welcome to check my codes and give any useful suggestions to me.

I'm trying to get the method IDs from all Ethereum published contracts.

Now the problem is I need to check and match the method id generated by my codes with that in Etherscan, but the way I used is a bit complex and time-slow. Because Contract.get_function_by_selector will return a class(or type) which contains all the information such as the entire contract ABI, this Method info, and so on, except Method ID :(

so my logic in ABI_checker simply is, if Etherscan could find a function by the method id you provided, then there won't be any problem.

Im trying to find a better and more efficient way to handle it.
Later I may upload a file used to automatically find all public contracts in Etherscan
